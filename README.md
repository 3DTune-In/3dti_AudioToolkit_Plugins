# 3D Tune-In Toolkit VST plugin

This repository includes a VST interface for the 3D Tune-In (3DTI) Toolkit, so that its functionalities can be integrated into a DAW application. The current version of this VST plugins includes three different plugins, Binaural spatialization (Anechoic and Reverb paths), Hearing Aid and Hearing Loss Simulator. 
For technical details, please refer to:

The 3DTI Toolkit is a standard C++ library for audio spatialisation and simulation using headphones developed within the 3D Tune-In (3DTI) project (http://www.3d-tune-in.eu), which aims at using 3D sound and simulating hearing loss and hearing aids within virtual environments and games. The Toolkit allows the design and rendering of highly realistic and immersive 3D audio, and the simulation of virtual hearing aid devices and of different typologies of hearing loss.

More information about the 3D Tune-In Toolkit can be found in the open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit/. Technical details about the 3D Tune-In Toolkit spatialiser are described in:
